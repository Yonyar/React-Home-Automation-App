# 🏠 React Home Automation App

Web application for intelligent home device management, developed with React, Node.js, and JavaScript.

This app allows users to add, remove, and control smart home devices — such as lights, fans, garage doors, and TVs — through an intuitive interface.
The project simulates the behavior of a home IoT system, focusing on providing a smooth user experience, a scalable architecture, and a dynamic frontend.

- **Frontend**: React (Functional components with Hooks)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: Firebase (real-time database for device management)
